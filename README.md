Web Fronted Development II
This course is designed to give students the skills required to create web applications using HTML, CSS , and Javascript. It is intended to help the student learn to do this without the aid of third-party frameworks or libraries. Because of this, the course focuses on how to solve larger, ill-structured business problems by designing and creating web applications to be run on mobile devices.
